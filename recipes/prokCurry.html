    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg pork leg, or shoulder, with some fat, diced into 2.5cm cubes</li>
        <li>100ml of malt vinegar</li>
        <li>4 medium onions, sliced into wedges</li>
        <li>1 knob of fresh ginger, 2cm long, peeled</li>
        <li>4 tbsp of groundnut oil, or another neutral-tasting oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of light soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Toss the pork thoroughly in the vinegar, then discard the vinegar (this imparts a slight sourness and is
            traditionally thought to clean the pork). Place the pork in a large saucepan and add enough water to just
            submerge. Cover the pan with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat. Turn the heat down to medium-low
            and continue to simmer, with the lid on, for 15 minutes</li>
        <li>Remove the pork and set aside, reserving the cooking liquor in a bowl. Do not wash the saucepan – you'll
            reuse it later</li>
        <li>Pound the ginger into a rough pulp using a pestle and mortar, then add 2 tbsp of water to make a ginger
            juice, then strain through a sieve, squeezing as much liquid out of the pulp as possible. Discard the pulp
            and reserve the liquid</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in the same saucepan used to boil the pork over a medium-high heat. Add the diced pork and fry
            for 4–5 minutes until browned all over. Add the onion wedges and ginger juice, then stir-fry for 1 minute.
            Add the reserved pork cooking liquor, sugar, soy sauces and pepper along with 500ml of water and bring to
            the boil</li>
        <li>Turn down the heat to medium-low and simmer for 1 1/2 hours until the sauce is sticky and reduced</li>
        <li>When the time is up, the pork should be tender and fall apart if you poke it with a fork. Serve with lots of
            fluffy white rice and stir-fried greens on the side</li>
    </ol>
